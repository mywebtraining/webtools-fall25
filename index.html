        <h2>My Launch Studio Introduction</h2>

        <section>
            <h3 id="about-me" class="scroll-stop">About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Stephen Herd, and I am beginning my journey into web development with Launch Studio.
                I've always been curious about how websites are built and how technology connects people,
                but until now, most of my experience has been on the user side of the screen. This class gives me the
                chance to move from being a consumer of the web to becoming a creator who understands the
                structure and logic behind the sites I use every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of school, I have a variety of interests that shape who I am as a person. I enjoy
                reading, gaming, fitness, music, or volunteering, and I often
                find connections between those hobbies and the skills I want to develop as a coder. For example,
                gaming has made me curious about interactive design.

                <h4>Professional Goals</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my goals as a student is to grow not just technically but also creatively. I want to learn how
                    to take an idea and bring it to life on the web, while also developing habits that make me a reliable
                    collaborator. By the end of this course, I hope to feel confident introducing myself as someone who
                    doesn't just study web development but actively practices it.
                </p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="dev-id" class="scroll-stop">Developer Identity</h3>
            <p>
                When I think about my developer identity, I see myself as someone who is just starting to
                learn the language of the web but already beginning to picture the kind of professional I want
                to become. At this stage, I identify most as a “junior developer in training.” I don't yet have
                all the answers, but I am learning how to ask the right questions, test my ideas, and rely on
                structured problem-solving to move forward.
            </p>
            <div class="clearfix bordered-box">
                <figure class="figure-left">
                    <a href="images/developer.png" target="_blank">
                        <img src="images/developer-md.png" class="fluid-image" alt="Developer image">
                    </a>
                </figure>
                <h4>Strengths</h4>
                <p>
                    My strengths as a developer come from qualities I already value in other areas of my life:
                    persistence, curiosity, and creativity. I may not write perfect code on the first try, but I am
                    willing to debug, research, and rework my approach until I find a solution. I also enjoy looking
                    for patterns, whether in code, design, or workflows, because patterns help me understand
                    how complex systems can be broken down into manageable steps.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Over time, I want my developer identity to reflect confidence and professionalism. I want to be
                seen not just as a student who completes assignments but as someone who brings a unique
                voice to projects and collaborates well with others. For now, I am comfortable identifying as
                a developer-in-progress who is building both technical skills and professional habits that will
                carry me into future opportunities.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="learning" class="scroll-stop">Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>
                My decision to take this course comes from a desire to better understand how the web works
                and to gain skills that are practical, creative, and in demand. I have used websites for as long
                as I can remember, but I've often wondered what happens behind the scenes. This course
                marks the beginning of my journey to move from curiosity into capability, where I can start
                building and not just browsing.
            </p>

                    </a>
                </figure>
                <h4>My Journey</h4>
                <p>
                    I expect that this journey will not always be easy. I know there will be moments of frustration
                    when code doesn't work or when I feel stuck on a problem. But I also see those challenges as
                    part of the process. Each mistake is a chance to learn, and each small success is a step
                    forward. I want to develop resilience as much as I develop technical knowledge, because both
                    are essential to becoming a capable web developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I hope to use the skills from this class to create projects that reflect both my
                    personality and my professional goals. I would like to design pages that are clean, accessible,
                    and meaningful for real users. Beyond this class, I want to keep expanding my knowledge
                    into areas like responsive design, interactivity, and eventually full-stack development. This
                    course is the launchpad for that larger journey, and I am excited to take the first steps here.
